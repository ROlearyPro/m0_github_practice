# GitHub Notes

To check your own understanding of GitHub, answer the questions that follow.

1. **What is the purpose of GitHub?** It's a way to store code in such a manner that one can safely iterate on multiple different versions of it, allow others to work on the same code as you at the same time, and merge and update said code as one wishes.
1. **What is the difference between forking and cloning a repository?** The difference is that while forking creates a copy of the reposity that allows one to build their own version off of it, cloning means that you are taking the repository and downloading it into your own local machine, meaning that you can only push, pull, and commit to that original repository, if you're even allowed to.s
